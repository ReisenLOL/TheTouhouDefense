so you might be wondering... WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?!?!?!??!
don't worry so am i.
anyways. i had an idea that, what if, touhou arknights is just a boring as fuck clone.
like, why play that game instead of the real deal arknights?
also because like it was getting increasingly boring to work on. felt like making something new
the core goal of this one is just:
defend [place], kill enemies, earn, upgrade.
that's it. no need  for fancy ranges, just these things
if i don't make something cool in like... i dunno 7 days i will cry. i won't but it'll just be unfortunate.
also i missed typing these long ass texts, i should get back into doing that again!!
yeah sure that feedback ain't helpin' them at all.

anyways game:
rounds of waves, after each round, you can choose an upgrade.
